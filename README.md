## üíª Installation Manual

Follow these steps to set up and run the VetGroom Hub project locally.

### Step 1: Install a Local Web Server (XAMPP)

The project requires a PHP and MySQL environment. We recommend using XAMPP Server.

* **Download Link:** [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html].

### Step 2: Set up Project Files

1.  Navigate to the installation directory of your local server (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\` for XAMPP).
2.  Clone the project or copy the entire **`VETGROOM_HUB`** folder into this directory.
3.  The main website files are located in `VETGROOM_HUB/codes/`.

### Step 3: Database Setup

1.  Start your Apache and MySQL services via the XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to **phpMyAdmin** (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
3.  **Create a New Database** named `if0_40217768_vetgroom` (same as the SQL dump).
4.  Select the new database, go to the **Import** tab, and upload the following file from the project's database folder:
    * `VETGROOM_HUB/database/if0_40217768_vetgroom.sql`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 4: Code File Path Correction (Critical Requirement)

**ATTENTION PROGRAMMERS/INSTALLERS:**

The project files have been restructured to meet the requirement of separating code by user role. This means that **all relative file paths** (`include`, `require`, `href`, `action`) within the PHP and HTML code **must be updated** to reflect the new directory structure. Please check and modify file paths in the code base, especially for links to shared assets (CSS/JS) and core backend logic.

Follow these steps for file extraction if you don't want to update the code:
1.  Create a new folder with any name. This will be your main folder.
2.  Extract all the files from `VETGROOM_HUB/database/` into the main folder.
3.  Inside `VETGROOM_HUB/codes/`, continue extracting all the files inside `admin`, `assets`, `backend`, `customer`, `staff`, `guest`, and also `index.php` to the main folder.
4.  The system should work correctly.

### Step 5: Access the System

1.  Open your browser and navigate to the project's entry point:
    * **Local Link:** `http://localhost/index.php`
2.  **Live Link:** [https://vetgroomhub.free.nf]
